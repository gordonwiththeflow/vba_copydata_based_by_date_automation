VBA Code for Copying Data Based on Date
Overview
This VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code is designed to copy data from a source sheet to a destination sheet based on matching dates. The code is intended to be used in Microsoft Excel and assumes that the data is organized in a specific structure within the workbooks.

Instructions
1. Set Up Workbook Paths
Modify the file paths in the code to match the locations of your source and destination workbooks. The paths are specified using cell references in the "Automation_main" workbook, so make sure to update these references accordingly.
2. Define Sheet Names
Ensure that the names of the source and destination sheets are specified in cells B4 and B32 of the "Automation_main" workbook, respectively.
3. Configure Date Columns
Set the columns containing dates in both the source and destination sheets. The column numbers or letters are specified in cells B5 and B33 of the "Automation_main" workbook.
4. Specify Profit Columns
Define the columns containing profit values in the source and destination sheets. The column letters are specified in cells B6 and B34 of the "Automation_main" workbook.
5. Run the Code
Execute the Sub Monday_CopyDataBasedOnDate to start the data copying process.
Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling. If the source or destination sheet specified in cells B4 or B32 is not found, a message box will appear, and the code will exit.
Data Copying Logic
The code loops through each row in the source sheet and checks if the date in the source sheet matches any date in the destination sheet.
If a matching date is found, the profit value from the source sheet is copied to the corresponding row in the destination sheet.
